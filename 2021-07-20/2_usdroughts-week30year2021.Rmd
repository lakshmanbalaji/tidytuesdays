# Background - the US Droughts dataset

* This week's *tidytuesday* plot was prompted by [this post by the NY Times.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/11/climate/california-western-drought-map.html)
* The TidyTuesday Github page has a dataset of droughts at the state level: to use that data, go [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) and navigate to the datasets section > year 2021 > week 30. Here is the specific link to this week's [dataset.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-20/readme.md.)
* However, I was more interested in the datasets provided by the source, [the US Drought Monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataDownload/ComprehensiveStatistics.aspx). 
* I downloaded, for every week in the last 5 years, a county-level dataset of the percent area in each county considered to be drought-free, and if experiencing drought (which can be classified into one of [five](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/About/WhatistheUSDM.aspx) levels), the percent area that falls into each drought level. Note: I prefered to set the _Statistics Type_ to 'Categorical' as opposed to cumulative. If you just want to replicate this analysis though, you don't need to download the data. Just use the .csv that I have included in this repo.
```{r settings for data, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Settings I used for the data pull" }

library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("0_settings_for_data_pull.jpg")

# Added a line to make sure code fits in chunk
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 60), tidy = TRUE)
```
* My original idea was to sum the percent of land in each county that falls into the **'severe (D2)', 'extreme (D3)', or 'exceptional (D4)'** categories and report that number on a map of the US as a single number â€” _the percent of land experiencing SEE (severe, extreme, exceptional) drought_ for every week in the last five years (using an animation), but I later cut down this scope to just the last two years (_June 16th 2019 - July 20th 2021) because the script was taking too long to run on my laptop.

## Libraries

Let's get our libraries loaded.

```{r libraries, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# basic libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(urbnmapr) # to get county and state boundaries
library(viridis)
library(kableExtra)


# for animation
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
#library(devtools)
#install_github('thomasp85/transformr')
library(transformr)
library(Rcpp)


```



# Import data

Read in the .csv from the repo.
```{r import data}

dat1 <- read.csv("1_dm_export_20150101_20210720.csv")

```


# Minor cleaning

* Remove Alaska and Hawaii
* Add week and year columns
```{r remove alaska hawaii and add week and year}

# see list of unique states represented in the data pull
# table(unique(dat1$State))
# remove non contiguous US: Alaska and Hawaii need to go
dat1 <- dat1 %>% 
       filter(!(State %in% c("AK", "HI")))
# should have 50 states now
# length(unique(dat1$State)) # 50 states represented in 1.08 million records


# Add week and year columns
dat1 <- dat1 %>%
        mutate(week      = lubridate::week(as.Date(ValidStart)),
               year      = lubridate::year(as.Date(ValidStart)),
               wkyr      = paste0(week, "-", year))

```

* Filter to just the last 2 years' worth of data.

```{r filter to last 2 years worth of data}

dat1 <- dat1 %>% 
        filter(as.Date(ValidStart) >= as.Date("2019-07-16")) # I wrote this script in July 2021 so chose July 2019 as cut-off
                                                             # Should have just 334,530 obs

```



* Add a variable that sums the percent of land area in each country in D2, D2 and D4 drought (hereafter referred to as **SEE drought** for severe, extreme and exceptional drought.)
* Change the variable that contains the FIPS code (the `FIPS` variable) to match the name and type of the FIPS variable county data that we will import later from `urbnmapr`.

```{r sum areas in d2 d3 d4}

# sum of area in d2, d3, and d4
dat1 <- dat1 %>%
        rowwise() %>%
        mutate(drought.see = sum(c_across(D2:D4))) %>%
        ungroup() # use ungroup() to exit rowwise() once you are done computing operations by row


# To match the urbnmapr county data (to be imported in the next step)
# Make sure that:
# FIPS is renamed to county_fips
# Make sure FIPS has five digits (pad with 0 in the front)
dat1 <- dat1 %>% 
        rename(county_fips = FIPS) %>%  
        mutate(county_fips = as.character(county_fips)) %>%
        mutate(county_fips = str_pad(county_fips, 5, "left", "0"))

```

* Look at a sample of the data.

```{r glimpse data sample, echo = FALSE}

dat1 %>%
head() %>%
select(county_fips, County, State, ValidStart, D2, D3, D4, drought.see) %>%
kbl(caption = "Sample of data prior to joining county boundaries") %>%
kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria") 


```
* In the above example, in the first row, for instance, Autauga County, in the week starting on 2021-07-13 (13th July 2021) had 0 percent of its land area classified as D2, 0 percent in D3 and 0 percent in D4. So the `drought.see` variable is 0, indicating that in this week, no part of Autauga Country was experiencing any severe, extreme or exceptional drought.



# Add county data and states data

* Note: we use the `urbnmapr::` package to add county data. Also load in state data. This chunk could take a long time to run so I recommend increasing memory prior to executing the code.

```{r join county data}

# my current memory size
memory.size() 
# check my limit
memory.limit() 
# change memory.limit()
memory.limit(size=56000) 


# join county data
dat1.counties<-  left_join(dat1, 
                           urbnmapr::counties, 
                           by = "county_fips")
# notice this dataset is huge because 
# for every row in the dat1 dataset,
# we join something like 50-60 elements (lines)
# representing the polygon outlines.

# create a states map
states.map <- urbnmapr::states %>% filter(!(state_name %in% c("Alaska", "Hawaii")))

```


# Plot animation


* Now, we go ahead and plot the animation. This chunk could take up to 15 minutes to run but the animation at the end is worth it.

```{r plot static figure, eval = FALSE, cache = TRUE, tidy = FALSE}



anim <-   ggplot(data = dat1.counties) +
          
        
          # County map
          geom_polygon(data = dat1.counties,
                       mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,
                                     group = group,
                                     fill = drought.see)) +

          # Add state outlines
          geom_polygon(data = states.map,
                       mapping = aes(long, lat,group = group),
                       fill = NA, color = "#ffffff", size = 0.4) +
  
          # color scale
          scale_fill_viridis(option = "B",
                             name = "Percent of land area experiencing SEE drought") +
  
          # coordinates
          coord_map(projection = "mercator") +

          # theme
          theme_minimal() +
  
         # other themes
          theme(
          legend.position = "bottom",
          legend.text.align = 0,
          plot.margin = unit(c(.5,.5,.2,.5), "cm")
          ) +
  
          theme(
          axis.line = element_blank(),

          axis.ticks = element_blank(),
          axis.title.x = element_blank(),
          axis.title.y = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          ) +
  
         theme(
         plot.title=element_text(face = "bold")
          ) +
  
          # transition: used the transition manual verb.
          transition_manual(frames = as.Date(ValidStart)) +
  

         # title
         labs(title = "Drought in US Counties",
              subtitle = paste0("Map shows percent of county land area experiencing \nsevere, extreme or exceptional (SEE) drought in the week of ",                                 "{current_frame}"),
              caption = "Data source: US Drought Monitor | TidyTuesdays | @LakshmanBalaji9")
