International Independence Days
================

# Background

-   We are going to use a *tidytuesday* dataset dealing with
    International Independence Days sourced from [*Wikipedia / Isabella
    Velasquez*](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-06/readme.md).
-   This data contains one row for each country, and tells you which
    year the country declared independence, and what the holiday is
    called and so on.
-   For this week, I will make a simple boxplot of the number of years
    elapsed since independence from the UK for each country. I picked
    the UK because this country was the most successful colonial power
    in terms of the territory it controlled (â€¦the sun never sets on the
    British Empire?)

### Libraries and data import

Load libaries

``` r

# Process data

Load data. This is week 28, year 2021 data.

``` r
# week 28, year 2021 data
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 28)$holidays
# or, alternatively, use these lines
# library(openxlsx)
# tuesdata <- read.xlsx("0_data.xlsx")

# grab everyone who go independence from the UK
ukleavers <- tuesdata %>%
filter(str_detect(independence_from, "(United Kingdom)|(Britain)")) %>%
filter(!is.na(year_of_event)) %>%
arrange(year_of_event) %>%
mutate(country = ifelse(country == "Gambia, The", "Gambia",
                 ifelse(country == "Bahamas, The", "Bahamas", country))) %>%
mutate(continent = countrycode(sourcevar = country, 
                               origin = "country.name",
                               destination = "continent"),
       age = round(as.numeric(difftime(Sys.Date(), date_parsed, units = "days"))/365.25, 2)) %>%
mutate(continent= factor(continent, levels = c("Europe", "Asia", "Africa", "Americas", "Oceania")))

# Plot

``` r
# exclude US and Brazil as they skew the plot. Mention in footnote.
ukleavers2 <- ukleavers %>% filter(!(country %in% c("United States", "Brazil")))


p<- ggplot(data = ukleavers2, aes(x = continent, y = age)) +
